# Build-A-Face-Mask-Detector-With-TensorFlow
During the COVID crisis, we’ve highlighted practical applications that aid in our safety - this week we’ll introduce some machine learning concepts into that pursuit! Face masks have become a mandatory feature in many segments of society and in this workshop, we’ll show you how to build a simple CNN (convolutional neural network) model to automatically detect whether someone is wearing one. For this purpose, we’ll use TensorFlow (in combination with Keras ). TensorFlow is a free open-source library developed by the Google team for data flow and symbolic math. Its prime application in practice has been neural network creation. In this session, we’ll be training -----------------------------------------  To learn more about The Assembly’s workshops, visit our website, social media or email us at workshops@theassembly.ae  ➡ Website: theassembly.ae  ➡ Follow us on our social media: • Instagram: instagram.com/makesmartthings • Facebook: fb.com/makesmartthings  • Twitter: twitter.com/makesmartthings
